# Tailwind Practice
 
This is a site I made while I was learning the Tailwindcss framework, I think it's more user friendly than bootstrap and I'm going to use it in the following works

## What I used
1. HTML
2. TailWind Css
3. JavaScript
4. Yarn
5. Live Server


## Fast start
- Clone the repository
- Go to the project folder
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Start building the CSS file: `yarn build`
- Open `index.html` in browser
